# Machine-Learning-Stock-Price-Predictor
Machine Learning algorithms applied to historical stock price data to predict future prices of stocks.


## Setting Up
Need the following libraries in Python 2.7:
```
requests
csv
bs4
```
Need to create a .txt file with all the ticker symbols of companies that are of interest. stockTickers.txt is a provided example of how it should be structured.

## Executing
The following command is to execute the python script that downloads all the historical price data of stocks you are interested in predicting prices for.
```
python downloadHistoricalData.py <your tickers .txt file here>
```
The script also executes a bash shell script that will clear the CSVFiles directory and move all the .csv files generated by the above python script into the CSVFiles Directory. Do not delete or alter this directory.
